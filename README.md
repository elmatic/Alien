# Description
Alien is a Python (text) based implementation of a [Role Playing Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game)(RPG) - [Single Player](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game#Single-player).

# Project Background
Alien was originally the final project for a course I was enrolled in at Southern New Hampshire University. I decided to try to teach myself a little more about Python and the different features I could implement in hopes to remove myself from [tutorial hell](https://medium.com/@dannywakeling/tutorial-hell-74ad0d7bbf04).

# Playing the Game

### How to Move
```
go North
go South
go East
go West
```

### How to Pickup Items
```
get <item-name>
```

### How to Exit the Game
```
exit
```

# Development Stage
I plan to keep this repository updated as I learn more methods of feature implementation, cleaner code, and overall better functionality.
