# Description
Alien is a Python (text) based implementation of a [Role Playing Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game)(RPG) - [Single Player](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game#Single-player).

# Project Background
Alien was originally the final project for a course I was enrolled in at Southern New Hampshire University. I decided to try to teach myself a little more about Python and the different features I could implement in hopes to remove myself from [tutorial hell](https://medium.com/@dannywakeling/tutorial-hell-74ad0d7bbf04).
